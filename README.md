NIMPA TEXT EDITOR 

Current Features:
- Text can be written
- Text can be added mid file.



Recent Changes:
- Text is now fully modular using the left and right arrows.
    - Users of this text editor now no longer have to get
    every word sentence right from the beginning! You can 
    now use your left and right arrows to add text. HOWEVER:
    you still need to spell everything right because there is
    NO backspace functionality yet. Who knew that programs
    literally don't know how to do anything on their own.
    Don't worry I will teach it how to do it in the near
    future but for now I have to get to sleep.
