NIMPA TEXT EDITOR 

Current Features:
- Text can be written
- Text can be added mid file.



Recent Changes:
- Text is now fully modular using the left and right arrows.
    - Users of this text editor now no longer have to get
    every word sentence right from the beginning! You can 
    now use your left and right arrows to add text. HOWEVER:
    you still need to spell everything right because there is
    NO backspace functionality yet. Who knew that programs
    literally don't know how to do anything on their own.
    Don't worry I will teach it how to do it in the near
    future but for now I have to get to sleep.

AUTHOR'S NOTES:
- On the surface, all you can do is type stuff right? YES and
under the surface that's also all it is. It literally took
like 400 lines of code to give someone the ability to type
stuff :). The more I got sucked into this project, the more
I realized, WOW, no one is going to care that I did this,
because its literally just typing, but here we are. it's 
actually crazy because I go to sleep and dream about how to 
solve problems I'm having in this project. It's problematic
to say the least. It has however made me realize that my
passion may be in tool creation rather than standard app dev.
Making something that could be useful to someone who makes
something is pretty interesting. And it makes me feel like 
my algorithm's and data structure classes are not useless
lmaoooo. Anyways I'm gonna work on my actual school work now
before I fail out of the school that is supposedly going to 
help me get a job one day. adios.
